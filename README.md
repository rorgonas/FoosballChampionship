To check it out, clone the repository, then:

```
# Use `package.json` to pull down the app's dependencies from NPM
$ npm install

# Use `bower.json` to pull down the app's dependencies from Bower
$ bower install

# The (unwritten) tests have Bower dependencies as well. Grab those:
$ cd test
$ bower install
```

Now that you have all of the pieces, try out:

`grunt serve` to create a development server, and
`grunt` to test and build the application.
